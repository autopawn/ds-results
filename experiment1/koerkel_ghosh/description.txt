Koerkel-Ghosh Benchmarks

Similar benchmarks: Bilde-Krarup, Uniform

Benchmarks of this type were initially proposed by Koerkel [1]. Here n = m, and connection costs are drawn uniformly at random from [1000, 2000]. Opening costs are drawn uniformly at random from [100, 200] in class A, from [1000, 2000] in class B and from [10000, 20000] in class C. Furthermore symmetric and asymmetric connection matrices are created. Our package provides instances of the 3 largest sizes presented in [2] with n = m = 250, 500 and 750. For each size, each type symmetric/asymmetric and each class it contains 5 instances resulting in a total of 90 instances. Symmetric and asymmetric instances can be downloaded separately on the download page here. Code for instance generators is also available.
